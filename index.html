							<div class="hero-p">
								<p class="p">Of the council of ministers of the USSR. There has been an accident at the Chernobyl nuclear station. One of the nuclear reactors has been damaged. Steps are being taken to deal with the consequences of the situation. The victims are being cared for. The government has formed a commission. The Soviet Union officially acknowledged this afternoon that a nuclear accident had occurred at one of its power plants. That of Chernobyl, in Ukraine. This accident has affected the Nordic countries, which are more than 1,000 kilometers away</p>
								<p class="p">The Soviets announce a nuclear accident in a power plant. "The Washington Post gave more seriousness to the problem:" The Soviet nuclear accident throws a radioactive cloud over Europe. <br> Finally, twenty days after the catastrophe, Mikhail has spoken Gorbachev. It would be absurd not to recognize some positive aspects in your speech. But in his words many reluctance and difficulties are still reflected, mainly in relation to publicity about the accident, whose very reality denies the stubborn tendency of the Soviets to present in optimistic tones everything that happens in their country</p>
								<p class="p">To prevent radioactivity from spreading in the environment, the reactor was filled with 5,000 tons of 	boron, dolomite, sand, clay, and lead compound, launched from a helicopter flying over the reactor. Those released materials extinguished the graphite fire and absorbed the radioactive aerosols.
								After two weeks, Soviet authorities decided to keep the entire block that had collapsed at the nuclear plant, in a special sarcophagus that was made of concrete with its own cooling system.
								The Chernobyl population was exposed to 100 times more radioactivity than was produced by the atomic bomb in Hiroshima.

							<h2 class="news_bolivar">Simon Bolivar & Philosopher Stone</h2>
							<div class="news_2-title">
								<p class="p2">Simón Bolívar was born on July 24, 1783, in Caracas, Venezuela, then part of the Hispanic colonial empire. His parents belonged to the aristocratic upper class, the Creoles. Orphaned at the age of 9, the boy early showed traits of independence and a strong will. Sent to Madrid in 1799 to complete his education, he came under the tutelage of an uncle who secured the proper instruction for the young aristocratic.
								</p>
								<p class="p2"> 
									At the age of 18 Bolívar married Maria Teresa de Toro. In 1802 the couple went to Caracas, where after only 6 months of wedded life the young wife died.
									<br>In 1804 Bolívar returned to Europe, this time visiting France and Italy. He was greatly impressed by Napoleon, who had crowned himself emperor, and Bolívar dreamed of a similar glory for himself.
